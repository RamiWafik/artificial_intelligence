# **List of projects in this folder**

##**1- Case Study With ANN and SOM**

##**2- Cat/Dog Classifier**

This project is a simple cat/dog classifier. Given a picture, it outputs either 0 (cat) or 1 (dog). Itâ€™s a convolutional neural network consisting of ...... (layers) implemented using Keras.

##**3- Churn Data Modeling**

This dataset contains users information of a certain app. It is used to predict wether the user will churn or not, so, this is a binary classification problem where the models outputs 1 if the user is predicted to churn and 0 if not.

##**4- Credit Card Fraud Detection**

Credit card fraud detection is a common problem in ML. This model is used to predict fraudulent transactions in order to prevent them (binary classification problem). The features in this dataset is encrypted to protect the customers private data but it is based on real frature about bank customers.

##**5- EValuating Credit Card Applications**

This model is used to evaluate credit card applications submitted by clients and deciding to approve or not. After the bank collects the needed information from customers it gives them to the model an get a prediction. This model uses the data about customers salary, job, age, credit history and other features to finally output a prediction.

##**6- Fashion Classification**

Using the famous mnist fashion dataset, a convolutional meural network is trained on the images in the dataset to predict the category of the clothing in the image. There are ......... categories, so the problem here is a multi class classification. Where the model outputs a label indicating the category of the clothing in the picture.

##**7- Google Stock Price**

Using recurrent neural network, a model was build to predict the google stock prices based on the dataset of the stock prices for the previous set of years.

##**8- Movie Recommender System**
