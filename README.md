# Artificial Intelligence

This is my work in artificial intelligence. This repo includes my experience in machine learning and Deep learning in the form of projects I worked on.

## **Deep Learning:**

Includes all my projects in deep learning and the datasets I used to train the neaural networks, SOM, Boltzmann machines and, Autoencoders. The aim of these projects was to start implementing DL neural networks and see how they work.

## **Machine Learning:**

Includes all my projects in machine learning and the datasets I used to train the models. Each project will have more than one script to get myself familiar with different ML algorithms and to find the best model for each case.

## **Dimensionality reduction techniques:**

This folder has examples of how to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the dimension of the dataset and improving the training phase of the model.

## **Templates:**

These templates are pieces of code that are reayd to be used in the exploratory data analysis phase.


## **MCIT AWS Machine Learning Training:**

These are the 4 use cases that I submitted during the 4 months of training. In them, I got hands on experience implementing ML algorithms using SageMaker and got familiar with different AWS tools.


## **Standford University Machine Learning COurse:**

I uploaded all the programming exercises I passed during there course. They are ML algorithms implemented from scratch where I wrote the code for training and tuning parameters, loss functions, and prediction. All this was done using MATLAB.

## **Deep Learning Specialization:**

This folder has the programming assignments I did during the deep learning specialization on Coursera in all the five courses included in the specialization.
