# Artificial Intelligence

This is my work in artificial intelligence. This repo includes my experience in machine learning and Deep learning in the form of projects I worked on.

**1- Deep Learning Folder:**

Includes all my projects in deep learning and the datasets I used to train the neaural networks, SOM, Boltzmann machines and, Autoencoders.

**2- Machine Learning:**

Includes all my projects in machine learning and the datasets I used to train the models.

**3- Dimensionality reduction techniques:**

This folder has examples of how to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the dimension of the dataset and improving the training phase of the model.

**4- Templates:**

These templates are pieces of code that are reayd to be used in the exploratory data analysis phase.
