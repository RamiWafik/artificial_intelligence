# Machine Learning Course on Coursera (offered by Stanford University)

This course is a machine learning course that introduces basic ideas and algorithms in machine learning and gives you the opportunity to implement them from scratch using Matlab. These are all the programming exercises in the course.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)
