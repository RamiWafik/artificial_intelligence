== Operations on Word Vectors

Welcome to your first assignment of Week 2, Course 5 of the Deep
Learning Specialization!

Because word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train,
most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings. In this
notebook youâ€™ll try your hand at loading, measuring similarity between,
and modifying pre-trained embeddings.

*After this assignment youâ€™ll be able to*:

* Explain how word embeddings capture relationships between words
* Load pre-trained word vectors
* Measure similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity
* Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to
Woman as King is to ____.

At the end of this notebook youâ€™ll have a chance to try an optional
exercise, where youâ€™ll modify word embeddings to reduce their gender
bias. Reducing bias is an important consideration in ML, so youâ€™re
encouraged to take this challenge!

## Packages

Letâ€™s get started! Run the following cell to load the packages youâ€™ll
need.


+*In[1]:*+

import numpy as np
from w2v_utils import *

## 1 - Load the Word Vectors

For this assignment, youâ€™ll use 50-dimensional GloVe vectors to
represent words. Run the following cell to load the `word_to_vec_map`.


+*In[2]:*+
[source, ipython3]
----
words, word_to_vec_map = read_glove_vecs('data/glove.6B.50d.txt')
----

Youâ€™ve loaded: - `words`: set of words in the vocabulary. -
`word_to_vec_map`: dictionary mapping words to their GloVe vector
representation.

## 2 - Embedding Vectors Versus One-Hot Vectors Recall from the lesson
videos that one-hot vectors donâ€™t do a good job of capturing the level
of similarity between words. This is because every one-hot vector has
the same Euclidean distance from any other one-hot vector.

Embedding vectors, such as GloVe vectors, provide much more useful
information about the meaning of individual words. +
Now, see how you can use GloVe vectors to measure the similarity between
two words!

## 3 - Cosine Similarity

To measure the similarity between two words, you need a way to measure
the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors for the two
words. Given two vectors latexmath:[$u$] and latexmath:[$v$], cosine
similarity is defined as follows:

[latexmath]
++++
\[\text{CosineSimilarity(u, v)} = \frac {u \cdot v} {||u||_2 ||v||_2} = cos(\theta)Â \tag{1}\]
++++

* latexmath:[$u \cdot v$] is the dot product (or inner product) of two
vectors
* latexmath:[$||u||_2$] is the norm (or length) of the vector
latexmath:[$u$]
* latexmath:[$\theta$] is the angle between latexmath:[$u$] and
latexmath:[$v$].
* The cosine similarity depends on the angle between latexmath:[$u$] and
latexmath:[$v$].
** If latexmath:[$u$] and latexmath:[$v$] are very similar, their cosine
similarity will be close to 1.
** If they are dissimilar, the cosine similarity will take a smaller
value.

Figure 1: The cosine of the angle between two vectors is a measure of
their similarity.

### Exercise 1 - cosine_similarity

Implement the function `cosine_similarity()` to evaluate the similarity
between word vectors.

*Reminder*: The norm of latexmath:[$u$] is defined as $ ||u||_2 = $

After you get the correct expected output, please feel free to modify
the inputs and measure the cosine similarity between other pairs of
words! Playing around with the cosine similarity of other inputs will
give you a better sense of how word vectors behave.

## 4 - Word Analogy Task

* In the word analogy task, complete this sentence: +
``__a__ is to _b_ as _c_ is to *____*''.
* An example is: +
`__man__ is to _woman_ as _king_ is to _queen_' .
* Youâ€™re trying to find a word _d_, such that the associated word
vectors latexmath:[$e_a, e_b, e_c, e_d$] are related in the following
manner: +
latexmath:[$e_b - e_a \approx e_d - e_c$]
* Measure the similarity between latexmath:[$e_b - e_a$] and

example, you can try small->smaller as big->?

== Congratulations!

Youâ€™ve come to the end of the graded portion of the assignment. By now,
youâ€™ve:

* Loaded some pre-trained word vectors
* Measured the similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity
* Used word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to
Woman as King is to __.

Cosine similarity is a relatively simple and intuitive, yet powerful,
method you can use to capture nuanced relationships between words. These
exercises should be helpful to you in explaining how it works, and
applying it to your own projects!

What you should remember:

* Cosine similarity is a good way to compare the similarity between
pairs of word vectors.
** Note that L2 (Euclidean) distance also works.
* For NLP applications, using a pre-trained set of word vectors is often
a great way to get started.

Even though youâ€™ve finished the graded portion, please take a look at
the rest of this notebook to learn about debiasing word vectors.

## 5 - Debiasing Word Vectors (OPTIONAL/UNGRADED)

In the following exercise, youâ€™ll examine gender biases that can be
reflected in a word embedding, and explore algorithms for reducing the
bias. In addition to learning about the topic of debiasing, this
exercise will also help hone your intuition about what word vectors are
doing. This section involves a bit of linear algebra, though you can
certainly complete it without being an expert! Go ahead and give it a
shot. This portion of the notebook is optional and is not gradedâ€¦so just
have fun and explore.

First, see how the GloVe word embeddings relate to gender. Youâ€™ll begin
by computing a vector latexmath:[$g = e_{woman}-e_{man}$], where
latexmath:[$e_{woman}$] represents the word vector corresponding to the
word _woman_, and latexmath:[$e_{man}$] corresponds to the word vector
corresponding to the word _man_. The resulting vector latexmath:[$g$]
roughly encodes the concept of ``gender''.

You might get a more accurate representation if you compute
latexmath:[$g_1 = e_{mother}-e_{father}$],
latexmath:[$g_2 = e_{girl}-e_{boy}$], etc. and average over them, but
just using latexmath:[$e_{woman}-e_{man}$] will give good enough results
for now.

Now, consider the cosine similarity of different words with
latexmath:[$g$]. What does a positive value of similarity mean, versus a
negative cosine similarity?

Do you notice anything surprising? It is astonishing how these results
reflect certain unhealthy gender stereotypes. For example, we see
``computer'' is negative and is closer in value to male first names,
while ``literature'' is positive and is closer to female first names.
Ouch!

Youâ€™ll see below how to reduce the bias of these vectors, using an
algorithm due to https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520[Boliukbasi et al.,
2016]. Note that some word pairs such as ``actor''/``actress'' or
``grandmother''/``grandfather'' should remain gender-specific, while
other words such as ``receptionist'' or ``technology'' should be
neutralized, i.e.Â not be gender-related. Youâ€™ll have to treat these two
types of words differently when debiasing.

### 5.1 - Neutralize Bias for Non-Gender Specific Words

The figure below should help you visualize what neutralizing does. If
youâ€™re using a 50-dimensional word embedding, the 50 dimensional space
can be split into two parts: The bias-direction latexmath:[$g$], and the
remaining 49 dimensions, which is called latexmath:[$g_{\perp}$] here.
In linear algebra, we say that the 49-dimensional
latexmath:[$g_{\perp}$] is perpendicular (or ``orthogonal'') to
latexmath:[$g$], meaning it is at 90 degrees to latexmath:[$g$]. The
neutralization step takes a vector such as
latexmath:[$e_{receptionist}$] and zeros out the component in the
direction of latexmath:[$g$], giving us
latexmath:[$e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$].

Even though latexmath:[$g_{\perp}$] is 49-dimensional, given the
limitations of what you can draw on a 2D screen, itâ€™s illustrated using
a 1-dimensional axis below.

Figure 2: The word vector for ``receptionist'' represented before and
after applying the neutralize operation.

### Exercise 3 - neutralize

Implement `neutralize()` to remove the bias of words such as
``receptionist'' or ``scientist.''

Given an input embedding latexmath:[$e$], you can use the following
formulas to compute latexmath:[$e^{debiased}$]:

[latexmath]
++++
\[e^{bias\_component} = \frac{e \cdot g}{||g||_2^2} * g\tag{2}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[e^{debiased} = e - e^{bias\_component}\tag{3}\]
++++

If you are an expert in linear algebra, you may recognize
latexmath:[$e^{bias\_component}$] as the projection of latexmath:[$e$]
onto the direction latexmath:[$g$]. If youâ€™re not an expert in linear
algebra, donâ€™t worry about this. ;)

### 5.2 - Equalization Algorithm for Gender-Specific Words

Next, letâ€™s see how debiasing can also be applied to word pairs such as
``actress'' and ``actor.'' Equalization is applied to pairs of words
that you might want to have differ only through the gender property. As
a concrete example, suppose that ``actress'' is closer to ``babysit''
than ``actor.'' By applying neutralization to ``babysit,'' you can
reduce the gender stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still
does not guarantee that ``actor'' and ``actress'' are equidistant from
``babysit.'' The equalization algorithm takes care of this.

The key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair
of words are equidistant from the 49-dimensional latexmath:[$g_\perp$].
The equalization step also ensures that the two equalized steps are now
the same distance from latexmath:[$e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$], or
from any other work that has been neutralized. Visually, this is how
equalization works:

The derivation of the linear algebra to do this is a bit more complex.
(See Bolukbasi et al., 2016 in the References for details.) Here are the
key equations:

[latexmath]
++++
\[ \mu = \frac{e_{w1} + e_{w2}}{2}\tag{4}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[ \mu_{B} = \frac {\mu \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
\tag{5}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[\mu_{\perp} = \mu - \mu_{B} \tag{6}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[ e_{w1B} = \frac {e_{w1} \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
\tag{7}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[ e_{w2B} = \frac {e_{w2} \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
\tag{8}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[e_{w1B}^{corrected} = \sqrt{ |{1 - ||\mu_{\perp} ||^2_2} |} * \frac{e_{\text{w1B}} - \mu_B} {||(e_{w1} - \mu_{\perp}) - \mu_B||_2} \tag{9}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[e_{w2B}^{corrected} = \sqrt{ |{1 - ||\mu_{\perp} ||^2_2} |} * \frac{e_{\text{w2B}} - \mu_B} {||(e_{w2} - \mu_{\perp}) - \mu_B||_2} \tag{10}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[e_1 = e_{w1B}^{corrected} + \mu_{\perp} \tag{11}\]
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\[e_2 = e_{w2B}^{corrected} + \mu_{\perp} \tag{12}\]
++++

### Exercise 4 - equalize

Implement the `equalize()` function below.

Use the equations above to get the final equalized version of the pair
of words. Good luck!

Go ahead and play with the input words in the cell above, to apply
equalization to other pairs of words.

Hint: Tryâ€¦

These debiasing algorithms are very helpful for reducing bias, but
arenâ€™t perfect and donâ€™t eliminate all traces of bias. For example, one
weakness of this implementation was that the bias direction
latexmath:[$g$] was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and
_man_. As discussed earlier, if latexmath:[$g$] were defined by
computing latexmath:[$g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$];
latexmath:[$g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$];
latexmath:[$g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$]; and so on and averaging over
them, you would obtain a better estimate of the ``gender'' dimension in
the 50 dimensional word embedding space. Feel free to play with these
types of variants as well!

== Congratulations!

You have come to the end of both graded and ungraded portions of this
notebook, and have seen several of the ways that word vectors can be
applied and modified. Great work pushing your knowledge in the areas of
neutralizing and equalizing word vectors! See you next time.
