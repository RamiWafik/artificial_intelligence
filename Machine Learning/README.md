## **2- Breast Cancer**

The breast cancer is a classification problems that decides wether a tumor is malignant or benign based on information about the patients and the tumor like the dimensions of the tumor, the model outputs 1 for malignant and 0 for benign

## **3- Churn Data Project**

This dataset contains users information of a certain app. It is used to predict wether the user will churn or not, so, this is a binary classification problem where the models outputs 1 if the user is predicted to churn and 0 if not.

## **4- Directing Customers to App Subscription**

## **5- Likelihood of E-Signing**

Predicting if the users are e-signing to a loan based on financial data related to each user so it is a binary classification model. In this model, Grid Search is used to further tune the hyperparameters of the model.

## **6- Mall Customers Spending Score**

A regression problem based on a dataset about mall customers that predicts their score in a promotions system made by the mall. This prediction is based on data of customers like how often do they visit the mall, how much they spend weekly, their salaries...

## **7- Market Products Organization**

This intresting model helps workers decide what products should be put together of near each other in the shop.

It is based on the purchase history of the shopâ€™s customers and outputs lists of items that should be grouped together.

## **8- Natural Language Processing**

A simple NLP model using Naive Bayes algorithm on customers review of a certain restaurant. The goal of the model is to classify if the review indicates that the customer liked the restaurant or not. It outputs 1 if the customer gave a good review and 0 for bad reviews.

## **9- Salary Estimation**

A simple data set with a small number of observations predicting the salary of a new employee. I used it to get myself familiar with different regression algorithms, seeing the different output of each one and what kind of data pre-processing needed for each one to get the best results.

## **10- Salary Estimation Based on Position**

This dataset is similar to the one in salary estimation but, the estimation is based on the position of the employee not his years of experience.

## **11- Social Network Ads**

The dataset has the user ID, gender, age, and estimated salary of customers who where shown a certain add and the label is 1 if the customer purchased the product and 0 if not. The model is trained to predict the label and classify the customers (binary classification).

## **12- Wine Classificatoin**

Classifying multiple wine products into different customers segments based on the attributes and components of each product. This can be used to determine the price or the target customers for each specific one.
